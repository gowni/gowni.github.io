    <h3>Plot Synopsis</h3>
    <p> The Pursuit of Happyness is a film adaptation of a memoir of the same name, depicting a part of
        the real life of now famous stock broker and businessman, Chris Gardner. The film specifically 
        revolves around Chris' struggle with homelessness while raising his toddler son and his inspiring
        story of becoming a successful stock broker and entrepreneur

    <h3>My review</h3>
    <p> This movie is an absolute classic and a must watch for everybody. The performance of Will Smith as 
        Chris Gardner particularly stands out in what I think is his career best performance. You feel his
        struggle and pain throughout the movie. You laugh and cry with him in this emotional ride. The ending 
        of the movie is an absolute tear-jerker and will stick with you long after the movie ends.
