    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
    <p>I am a senior studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am very
        passionate about tech for social good and am eager to make developments in that field. Outside of 
        academics and work, my two great interests are film and mental health. I love studying the art of 
        filmmaking and enjoy discovering new movies. I also care deeply about mental health and aim to work
        towards the improvement of that field.
