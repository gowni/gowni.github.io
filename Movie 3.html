    <h3>Plot Synopsis</h3>
    <p> The Wailing is a horror mystery which tells the story of a police officer in a South Korean
        village, Jong-Goo. When a Japanese man newly moves into his village, a mysterious
        infection starts spreading causing people to kill their own families. How Jong-Goo, tackles this 
        infection and what the Japanese man has to do with it forms the rest of the story.

    <h3>My review</h3>
    <p> The Wailing is my current favorite horror movie of all time. Rather than throwing some cheap
        jump-scares at the audience and calling it a day, the film takes its time and contantly builds the
        tension to provide a great pay-off at the climax. It is definitely a slow-burn which might not 
        appeal to everyone, but it is one of the most well crafted horror stories I have ever seen. I highly 
        recommend everyone to check it out
    </p>
